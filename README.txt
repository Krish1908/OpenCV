Hey there,

To run and execute this project, kindly install the following dependencies, OpenCV, dlib, (to install dlib, you must install Visual C++, Cmake).

Once you have these dependencies installed in your system, kindly maintain a separate folder which contains the source code (.py), the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file (this will be available online, kindly download this too) and the sound files.

100%, the code will work.
